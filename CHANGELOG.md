# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
The wire/contract surface (token shapes, cookie names, the error envelope) is
treated as the public API for SemVer purposes — a breaking wire change is a major
version bump.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial workspace scaffolding: the Cargo workspace, the facade and internal
  crate skeletons, the WASM edge binding, the npm package stub, the pinned
  toolchain and lint posture, the supply-chain policy (`cargo-deny` / `cargo-vet`),
  the CI workflow, and the repository governance files.
